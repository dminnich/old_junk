Wrting this ISO to a USB flash drive

Prepare the drive. 
fdisk /dev/sdc

IF ANYTHING IS CURRENTLY ON YOUR DRIVE---
delete anything that is there with d.  
save changes with w.  
then issue partprobe and come right back into fdisk.

WITH A CLEAN DRIVE---
n for new partition. 
p for primary. 1.  
whatever size.  
t change type to b which is fat32.  
a 1 to make it bootable.  
w.  to write and quit. 
partprobe to see your changes.  


Format your new partition
mkfs.vfat /dev/sdc1

Install syslinux bootloader on it
syslinux /dev/sdc1 


Mount the ISO and copy over the files
mount -o loop ks.20100603.iso /mnt/loop 
cp -Rfa /mnt/loop/* /media/disk

Rename isolinux.cfg to syslinux.cfg
mv /media/disk/isolinux.cfg /media/disk/syslinux.cfg


When booting off USB pen drive, the machine is to stupid to find the ks config files.  I think this has to do with device naming and how it could change on various machines.  We will be injecting our kickstart configs into our initrd images to work around this. 

Extract the initrd images. 
gunzip < initrd32.img > initrd32.raw
gunzip < isolinux/initrd.img > initrd.raw



Copy the kickstart configs to the uncompressed initrd images.  
ls *cfg | cpio -oAO initrd32.raw -H newc
ls *cfg | cpio -oAO initrd64.raw -H newc

Re-compress the initrd images.  
gzip -c initrd32.raw > initrd32.img
gzip -c initrd64.raw > initrd64.img



Update the syslinux.cfg.  Change the ks=cdrom to ks=file. Like this...
ks=cdrom:/client32.cfg
TO 
ks=file:/client32.cfg



Sync the drive.  Pull it and try it.
